# AR-Application-for-Geo-Spatial-Navigation
Code created for my Bachelor's thesis - Based on Wikitude Cordova

**Author: Christina Trialoni**

The goal of this thesis is the design of a mobile application that features augmented reality features.

The application is targeted to tourists, but can be used by anyone who wants to navigate in a city and visit various areas. A user who runs this application can see points of interest through his smartphone’s screen and get information about one place by tapping on a special marker on his screen that is placed in the location of the special place.

This application is developed on Wikitude’s extension called Cordova plugin, on Android Studio. The data that is used and edited for the application is requested from Google’s Services, specifically Google Places/Maps API.

Wikitude’s tools, with the combination of Cordova’s features, allow for the application to have augmented reality features and location awareness respectively, while Google Places API provides the data and position of locations, called Points of Interest.
The code is written in JavaScript, HTML and CSS. The logic of this project, as well as internal tools and calls, are done with JavaScript, while the design and appearance is handled by HTML and CSS.
